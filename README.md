## Hack

To be hacked, the PFM requires the dev environment (or just a CouchDB plus the [Data System](https://github.com/mycozycloud/cozy-data-system)). Then you can start the PFM
this way:

    https://github.com/seeker89/cozycloud-pfm.git
    coffee server.coffee

Since the sources are in CoffeeScript, each modification requires a new build **before pushing** (you can just develop with the coffee version). Here is how to run a build:

    cake build

## Tests

To run tests type the following command into the Cozy Home folder:

    cake tests

## License

Cozy Proxy is developed by Cozy Cloud and distributed under the AGPL v3 license.
